    "text": "I am taking E155 because I really enjoyed E85 and want to explore computer engineering further. I am excited for the labs, since I enjoy their hands-on aspect. My main goals for the class are to enjoy the experience, learn a lot, and have fun while doing it.\nMore specific goals I have are to get comfortable with coding in Verilog and to deepen my understanding of how microcontrollers work. Overall, Iâ€™m looking forward to diving into these topics, challenging myself, and growing my technical skills."
